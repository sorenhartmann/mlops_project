Machine Learning Operations Project
==============================

Project Description
------------
The overall goal of this project is to use transformers for predicting whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. We intend to ensure reproducibility of the code using the principles presented in the MLOps course. The experiment visualizer `wandb` will be used for creating dashboards showing the main results of this project. Additionally, profilers may be used for identifying possible bottlenecks in the code.

The framework we will be using is [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). from the Pytorch Ecosystem. A pre-trained model provided by the repository will be used to perform NLP tasks such as feature extraction and prediction. This includes [ConvBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108) from the transformers framework.

Data is from the competition "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data). It consists of the text from a tweet, a keyword from that tweet and the location where that tweet was sent from. These data set features will be used to classify which tweets are about a real disaster and which ones are not. 


If time we will submit our contribution to the Kaggle competition.
